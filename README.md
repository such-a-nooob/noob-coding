# coding-basics
This is how i started ( Still here tho T_T ).
This repository contains some C/C++ codes covering some basic aspects of coding ( I did while schooling ).
The programs were written on TurboC.
If you are using the same then cool, but if not then do comment the clrscr() and getch() before compiling!
Happy coding!
